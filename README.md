============

Personnal vim settings for web developpement.

**To use**
* Copy the .vimrc file to your home `cp .vimrc ~/`
* Untar the .vim folder in your home `tar -xvf .vim -C ~/`
* Restart your vim if it was already launched.

_In case of graphical glitches in the top/bottom bar_
* First (and easiest) solution : disable powerline font.
  Go to line 361 in .vimrc and set airline_powerline_fonts to **0**.
* Second solution : Install one of the patched powerline's font.
  See [powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) repository
